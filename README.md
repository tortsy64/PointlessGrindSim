Tom, check out projects and shit, for goals etc, and take one of the things on the project board (or make a goal yourself idk).


Also, copy the master file if in doubt to get a stable build and work off that. When you're done with edits, make a pull request to add your changes to the repository, but make sure there's no bugs.
