Tom, check out projects and shit, for goals etc, and take one of the things on the project board (or make a goal yourself idk).


Also, copy the master file if in doubt to get a stable build and work off that. When you're done with edits, make a Tom branch and commit to the Tom branch and when you wanna add a feature to the main master branch, make a pull request to merge your branch to the master branch, but please for the love of Godd make sure the code is stable, and works bug free. Beta testing shit is for the Tom branch
